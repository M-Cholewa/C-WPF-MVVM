## Technologies

### WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
WPF is a UI framework for building desktop applications on Windows. It provides a rich set of features, including data binding, styles, and templates, allowing developers to create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces.

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
MVVM is a design pattern used in WPF applications to separate concerns and improve code maintainability. In this pattern:
- **Model** represents the application's data and business logic.
- **View** is the user interface, which displays data and captures user input.
- **ViewModel** acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, exposing data and commands that the View can bind to. This separation allows for easier testing and better organization of code.

### Specification Pattern
The Specification Pattern is a design pattern used to encapsulate business rules and validation logic. It allows for the creation of reusable and combinable specifications that can be applied to different entities. In this application, the Specification Pattern can be used to validate product attributes, ensuring that they meet defined criteria before being saved or updated. This approach promotes cleaner code and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.
